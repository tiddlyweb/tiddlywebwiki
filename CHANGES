    * Ignoring reserved fields when importing a TiddlyWiki document
    * Improved dependency management
      This consitutes a slight break in backwards comaptibility; existing
      instance configurations (tiddlywebconfig.py) should be updated to use
      "tiddlywebplugins.status" instead of "status" in system_plugins

0.11 Thu Oct 15 10:27:18 BST 2009

    * Added twinstance script to simplify instance creation, replacing
      the twanager instance command
    * Renamed from_svn twanager command to twimport
    * Reordered arguments for twanager imwiki

    * Added client-side support for inspecting and comparing revisions

0.9 Wed Sep  2 13:43:21 BST 2009

    * Corrected a cyclic dependency problem when installing
      tiddlywebwiki by moving import statements in __init__ into init()

0.8 Thu Aug 27 16:40:09 BST 2009

    * Client-side plugins are now included in the distribution
      These components no longer need to be downloaded from the TiddlyWiki
      Subversion repository when creating or updating an instance.
    * Moved plugin initialization into tiddlywebwiki.__init__
      This consitutes a slight break in backwards comaptibility, as
      existing instances' tiddlywebconfig.py needs to be updated to use
      tiddlywebwiki instead of tiddlywebwiki.plugin in system_plugins and
      twanager_plugins.
